Visualisation Engine Readme

Overview: some addons and modifications to Kelvin's original google maps display

1. Added javascript to read and display data from weatherhistory xml.
2. Added play button, progress slider, speed control
3. Words display are temporary prototype, will replace with visuals soon
4. To get it to work, it requires server or local server as xmlhttprequest is being used to get the xml data and this cannot access local files.
5. Place weather_history2013_14.xml and index.htm in same directory on same server, then start index.htm on any browser
